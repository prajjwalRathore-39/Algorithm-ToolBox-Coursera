Solving Programming Challenges
Total points 5
1.
Question 1
What will you typically need to implement yourself in the programming assignments if you program in C++, Java or Python?


1 / 1 point


Just reading the input.




Just writing the output.




Just the solution of the problem.    CORRECT




Reading input, writing output and the solution to the problem.


Correct
We will provide starter files for C++, Java and Python. In most cases, these will contain the implementation of reading the input and writing the output, and you will only need to implement the correct solution to the problem.  

2.
Question 2
Your program in C, C++ or Java thinks that the product of numbers 
50000
50000 and 
50000
50000 is equal to 
−
1794967296
−1794967296. What is the most probable reason?


1 / 1 point


The input data is incorrect.




The problem statement is wrong.




Integer overflow.       CORRECT




Compiler error.


Correct
Right!

3.
Question 3
Which tests should you perform before submitting a solution to the programming assignment?


1 / 1 point


Just submit the program and see if it passes the assignment.




Just check that the answers for the examples from the problem statement are correct.




Test on the examples from the problem statement. Then make a few other small tests, solve them manually and check that your program outputs the correct answer. Generate a big input and launch your program to check that it works fast enough and doesn't consume too much memory. Test for corner cases: smallest allowed values and largest allowed values of all input parameters, equal numbers in the input, very long strings, etc. Then make a stress test. After all these tests passed, submit the solution.      CORRECT




Test on the examples from the problem statement. Then make a few other small tests, solve them manually and check that your program outputs the correct answer. After all these tests passed, submit the solution.


Correct
Bingo!

Question 4
Where does the input data come from when you implement a stress test?


1 / 1 point


You generate valid input data as a part of the stress test implementation.      CORRECT




You download and use the tests we've prepared to check your solution to the problem.




You enter the input data manually.


Correct
Right!

5.
Question 5
If you submit a solution of a programming assignment, but it does not pass some of the tests, what feedback will you get from the system?


1 / 1 point


You will only get the feedback that your program either passed or did not pass.




If it is one of the first few tests, you will see the input data, the answer of your program and the correct answer. Otherwise, you will only see either that the answer of your program is wrong or that your program is too slow or that your program uses too much memory.         CORRECT




You will see the input data, the answer of your program, the correct answer, how long did your program work and how much memory did it use for each of the tests.


Correct
You need to learn to write programs that work correctly even on the tests you don't see.
